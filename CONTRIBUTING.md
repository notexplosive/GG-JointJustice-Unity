## Setup

## Committing Changes

1. Fork the repo using the "Fork" button at the top right on GitHub. This will create a copy of the repo on your GitHub profile.
2. Clone your forked repo, should look something like: `git clone https://github.com/<username>/GG-JointJustice-Unity.git`
3. Create a branch `git checkout -b <username>/<change-name>`. So if your username is `BobJohnson` and your change involves fixing line endings you might create a branch called `BobJohnson/line-endings`.
4. Make the changes! You can do this in as many or as few commits as you want, we'll squash it on merge if it's too many.
5. Once you're ready for us to review your changes, do a `git push` of your branch. You might need to do a `git push --set-upstream origin <username>/<change-name>`, git's error messages should help you here.
6. Once you've pushed you should get a URL to open a pull request, do that, fill out a title and a description. If this change addresses something from the google sheet, indicate the row number in the title.
